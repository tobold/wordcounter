# Word Counter
A javascript application that counts each individual word in a text file.

## Approach
I began by domain mapping how the application would run, as well as how the user would interact with it. I decided to create a simple browser application rather than using a server or any frameworks.
I used TDD to guide the process and ensure units were encapsulated to help debugging.

## Technologies used
- javascript
- jasmine

## Setup Instructions
```sh
git clone git@github.com:tobold/wordcounter.git
cd wordcounter
open index.html

open ./spec/SpecRunner.html #for tests
```

## Instructions for use
click 'choose file' and select a text file (railway children has been provided).
click 'count!'
